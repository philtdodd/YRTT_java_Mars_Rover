## Designing a Mars Rover

The Initial part fo this project was to think of the requirements and add them to a project in GitHub. These 
requirements were categorised into "Basic Requirements" and then requirements for "Planet" and "Rover".

This requirements list allowed me to focus on the minimum requirement specifications 
when starting coding.

The UML considered all the requirements as that was key to making the system extensible. This gave 
details of how to design a vehicle that had multiple capabilities 

The great thing about this approach was that the code could be built uo from the basic requirements with little change
to the design. And only a few modifications needed to be made to the UML as the implementstion went along.

With the ability for subterranean, satalites, and flying aircraft, as well as multple rover's and handling the surface 
of the planet, this design is very flexible. It can even model the whole solar system with a basic extension.

The design idea was to keep any visualisation of the planet surface to be kep seperaste from the actual vehicles in 
the model, the returned results would be used to update a visual grid at mission control. As you would only transmit 
the minimal info from a planet back to earth as data transmission is expensive and takes time.
